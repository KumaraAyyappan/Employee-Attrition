Data Analysis and Classification Using Python
This project demonstrates a pipeline for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning classification using Python. It utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, and XGBoost.

Features
Data Processing and Visualization: Efficiently process data using Pandas and visualize trends and distributions with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and interactive Plotly charts.
Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Logistic Regression
XGBoost Classifier
Handling Imbalanced Datasets: Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for oversampling imbalanced datasets.
Model Evaluation: Provides metrics like accuracy, log loss, and a detailed classification report.
Installation
